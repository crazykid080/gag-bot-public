## 1. Information We Collect

We only collect:
- **Your Discord user ID**
- **Command usage and arguments** when an error occurs

This data is necessary to identify users, enable app functionality, and assist with addressing errors. No other personal data is stored.

## 2. Message Handling

Messages are processed **in real time** to provide functionality (e.g., respond to commands or perform actions).  
**We do not store or log message content.** Once processed, messages are immediately discarded.  
However, **if an error occurs**, the command and its arguments may be temporarily logged for debugging purposes.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your Discord user ID to:
- Identify your account in our system

- Enable customization and tracking features

We may also use **command usage and arguments** in the event of an error to:
- Diagnose and fix issues
- Improve bot reliability and performance

## 4. Data Retention

Your Discord user ID is retained as long as your account interacts with the App or until you request deletion.  
Error-related command data is stored temporarily and deleted after it is no longer needed for debugging.

You may request data deletion at any time by:
- Contacting us at **crazykid080@gmail.com**
- Using the `/delete_user` command

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or disclose your information to third parties, except:
- When required by law
- To ensure App functionality (e.g., server hosting providers)

## 6. Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to secure your data. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.

## 7. Children's Privacy

This App is **not intended for users under 18 years of age or the age of digital consent in their jurisdiction, whichever is higher**.  
We do not knowingly collect data from such users. If you believe this has occurred, contact us immediately for removal.
