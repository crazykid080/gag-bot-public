# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 04/22/2025  
**Last Updated:** 02/02/2026

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use **Gag bot**.

## 1. Information We Collect

We limit our data collection to the minimum necessary for the App to function:
* **Core Account Data:** Your Discord user ID.
* **Error Logs:** Command usage and arguments provided during a system error or crash.
* **Anonymized Metrics:** Aggregated usage statistics (e.g., total command volume, server counts) which do not identify individual users.
* **Discord API Data:** To execute commands, the App accesses standard data provided by the Discord API (such as server roles, permissions, and usernames). This data is generally used in real-time and is not permanently stored unless specifically noted.

## 2. Message Handling

Messages are processed **in real time** to provide functionality (e.g., responding to commands or performing actions).
* **No Storage of Content:** We do not store or log general message content. Once processed, the message is immediately discarded.
* **Error Exceptions:** If a command fails, the specific command and its arguments may be temporarily logged to help our developers fix the bug.
* **Anonymized Statistics:** We may log that a command was used and at what time for performance monitoring. This does not include user-identifying data.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your Discord user ID and associated API data to:
* Identify your account and apply settings (such as mutes/gags).
* Enable customization and tracking features within your server.
* Analyze overall usage trends to improve the App’s performance.

We use **error-related logs** to:
* Diagnose and fix technical issues.
* Improve bot reliability and stability.

## 4. Data Retention

* **User ID:** Retained as long as your account interacts with the App or until you request deletion.
* **Error Logs:** Stored temporarily and deleted once the technical issue has been addressed.
* **Anonymized Metrics:** May be stored indefinitely as they do not constitute personal data.

You may request data deletion at any time by:
* Contacting us at **crazykid080@gmail.com**
* Using the `/delete_user` command
* Joining our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/wMmbp5BGZb)

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or disclose your information to third parties, except:
* When required by law.
* To our hosting providers (strictly for maintaining App operation).

## 6. Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to secure your data. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.

## 7. Children's Privacy

This App is **not intended for users under 18 years of age or the age of digital consent in their jurisdiction, whichever is higher**. We do not knowingly collect data from such users. If you believe this has occurred, contact us immediately for removal.

## 8. International Users

By using the App, you acknowledge that your data may be stored or processed in the United States.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be announced via our Discord bot or support channel.
