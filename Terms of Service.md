# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** 04/22/2025  
**Last Updated:** 02/02/2026

Welcome to **Gag bot**, a Discord application (the “App”) designed to enhance your experience on the Discord platform. By using our App, you agree to the following Terms of Service.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), and all applicable laws. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 2. Eligibility
You may only use this App if you are **at least 18 years of age or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher**. By using the App, you affirm that you meet this requirement.

## 3. Description of Service
The App provides services to mute ("gag") a user in servers using the App, and interacts with the Discord platform through authorized APIs.

## 4. Data Collection and Usage
We are committed to data minimization. Our collection practices are as follows:
* **Core Data:** We store **only your Discord user ID** to provide core features and maintain settings.
* **Anonymized Metrics:** We may collect anonymized, aggregated usage data (such as command frequency and server count) to improve performance and monitor App growth. This data contains no personally identifiable information (PII).
* **Transient Processing:** We **do not store message content**. Messages are processed transiently to execute commands and are then immediately discarded.

## 5. Discord API Data Access
The App operates by interacting with the Discord API. To perform its functions (such as managing roles or applying mutes), the App may access "API Data" provided by Discord. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Server member lists and roles.
* Public profile information (usernames, avatars).
* Channel and server permissions.

This data is accessed in real-time as needed to execute commands and is not permanently stored by the App unless explicitly stated in Section 4. Your use of the App constitutes acknowledgment that the App will access this data as permitted by your server's settings and Discord’s own privacy controls.

## 6. Error Handling and Stability
To provide a reliable experience, the App may collect automated error reports and logs when a crash or malfunction occurs. These logs are used strictly for debugging and technical improvements. While we strive for 100% uptime, service may be interrupted for maintenance or due to technical failures.

## 7. User Conduct
You agree to:
* Use the App only for lawful purposes.
* Not attempt to interfere with the App’s normal operation.
* Not reverse-engineer or attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the App.

## 8. Privacy
We take your privacy seriously. Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/crazykid080/gag-bot-public/blob/main/Privacy%20Policy.md) for details on data collection, usage, and your rights.

## 9. Account Termination
We reserve the right to suspend or permanently revoke access to the App if you violate these terms or Discord's terms.

## 10. Data Deletion
You may request removal of your stored data (user ID) at any time by contacting us on Discord in our server using this [Link](https://discord.gg/wMmbp5BGZb), through email at **crazykid080@gmail.com**, or using an available in-app command (`/delete_user`).

## 11. User Submissions and Suggestions
By submitting feedback, ideas, or feature suggestions, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable license to use and implement such submissions without compensation or attribution to you. 

## 12. Disclaimer of Warranty
The App is provided “as-is” and “as-available.” While we utilize error-handling protocols to minimize disruptions, we do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.

## 13. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the App.

## 14. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

## 15. Contact Us
